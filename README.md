# Docker Compose + Express + AngularJS (Material - ocLazyLoad) + Webpack 2 + NGINX
![angular 1.5.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/angular-1.5.9-brightgreen.svg) ![webpack 2.2.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-2.2.1-brightgreen.svg) ![NGINX 1.11.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/NGINX-1.11.10-brightgreen.svg) ![License MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This is an express server setup being built using webpack, and running lazy-loaded angular-material on the frontend.
All inside Docker.

### Current Webpack Configs
- Reads Sass & bundles into the final CSS üéâ
- Can make multiple bundles with multiple entries üòç
- Removes all console.log calls üôè
- Removes all comments üëå
- Bundles CSS, JS, images, fonts & videos
- Excracts bundles to files instead of inline (all minified) üî•

**The `docker-compose-alpine.yml` file currently only supports alpine for NGINX, since sass-loader is still problematic on alpine** üòû

### Usage
**1-** Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/preciousDev/dockerCompose-angularJS-webpack2-NGINX.git
```

**2-** Create a docker-machine
```shell
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox test
```

**3-** Switch to the new machine
```shell
docker-machine env test
```

**4-** Run this command to configure your shell:
```shell
eval $(docker-machine env test)
```

**5-** Build through docker-compose:
```shell
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**6-** After the build is finish, bring the containers up using:
```shell
docker-compose up
```

### Important Note
Ideally you'd want to `cd` into the `nodeapp` folder, run webpack-dev-server and keep applying your changes.
Once you're done, you would build out the containers.

- **To Run webpack-dev-server**
```shell
cd nodeapp && npm run dev
```

- **Build using webpack and run the express server**
```shell
cd nodeapp && npm run prod
```

- **Run the express server without building**
```shell
cd nodeapp && npm start
```
